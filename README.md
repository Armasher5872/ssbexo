Super Smash Bros: EXO is a free to play fan made modification for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. While not being the largest or most ambitious overhaul for Ultimate atm, it's intended goal may make it the largest at some point in the future, with said goals being:

- Rebalance the game to make it so that everyone is viable, and balance around casual and competitive play.

- Adds many universal mechanics to make players have more options at their disposal, or to lessen/remove the unneccesary and possibly harmful mechanics of Ultimate, some of which include:

  Vastly overhauled shields and a rework to shield breaking in general
  Overhauled parrying to be significantly stronger (Parry Reflection/Parry Recoil)
  Standardization of Dodge Framedata
  Overhauled Airdodges to make them more useful
  Replacement of SDI for ASDI (Automatic Smash Directional Influence)
  Reintroduction of Crouch Canceling
  Toned down infinte buffer to 15 frames max
  Lowered the "stickiness" of platforms
  Lowered traction
  Aerial Turnarounds
  DACUS/DACDS
  Increased Aerial Grab Ranges
  Removal of mechanics like Rage, Spotdodge Canceling, Hitstun Canceling, Phantom Hits, and the Homogenization of Fall Speed/Gravity during Hitstun

- To redesign most characters who need an overhaul, such as Sonic, Ganon, Samus, etc..., or to give a unique change to them
